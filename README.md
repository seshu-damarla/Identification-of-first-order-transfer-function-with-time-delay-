# Identification-of-first-order-transfer-function-with-time-delay
This repository demonstrates how to identify a dynamic system's behavior using a first-order model with time delay. The process involves determining three key parameters: process gain, time constant, and time delay.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection: Gather input-output data through system tests, such as step or impulse responses.
Model Approximation: Analyze the system's response to estimate the parameters using graphical techniques, optimization methods, or curve fitting.
Parameter Estimation:
Process Gain: Represents the system's steady-state response to input changes.
Time Constant: Reflects how quickly the system reacts to changes.
Time Delay: Captures the time lag between the input change and the system's initial response.
This repository provides code and examples to illustrate the identification process, leveraging Python tools like SciPy and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization.
